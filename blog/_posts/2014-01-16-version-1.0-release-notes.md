After a year and a half of work, I am proud to announce the [release of Pocket Linesman 1.0](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pocket-linesman-referee-wallet/id712375993?ls=1&mt=8).

Release Notes:

* A simple, distraction free design to help you never miss a moment during your matches.
* Voice and Text notes to help you quickly capture observations to refer to later.
* E-mail match summaries to your referee team or fellow spectators
* All of the tools that come in a normal referee wallet (timer, scorecard, and tracking Cautionable and Send Off offenses).
